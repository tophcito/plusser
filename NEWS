Changes in version 0.3-5 (2014-04-01)

Bugfixes
* Additional person fields removed from DESCRIPTION.

Changes in version 0.3-4 (2014-03-24)

Bugfixes
* DESCRIPTION now has a Maintainer field, as binary build servers require this.

Changes in version 0.3-3 (2014-03-14)

Improvements
* Harvesting profiles now returns also a profile's website (if it has one).
* Searching for profiles now returns an additional column differentiating
  between profiles and pages.

Bugfixes
* Some columns of the results when harvesting profiles were always NA because
  the corresponding field had not been selected. All fields are now selected.
* Also when harvesting profiles, type was always NA; this is now fixed.

Changes in version 0.3-2 (2014-03-05)

Improvements
* Dropping the knitr dependency for now, as a vignette is unlikely to be
  included due to authentication issues. 

Bugfixes
* The Google+ API key is now stored in a private environment instead of
  .Globalenv. This is required to pass CRAN checks and safeguards against
  overwriting userspace variables.


Changes in version 0.3-1 (2014-03-04)

Bugfixes
* The age of a post (as returned by 'parsePost') is now always in days.
  Previously, posts that were younger than a day had their age returned in
  hours. This led to inconsistencies in the interpretation of age. 

Changes in version 0.3-0 (2014-03-03)

Improvements
* harvestProfile is now vectorized, accepting a vector of user IDs.
* All functions that depend on it now fail gracefully if no API key has been 
  set.
* Functions now use a basic heuristic in validating their respective arguments.

Changes in version 0.2-0 (2014-02-28)

New Features
* Gained two functions to harvest user profiles and user IDs of users acting on
  a post.
* Gained a function to search profiles for query strings.
* Gained a function to search for a query in posts.


Documentation

* Every function now contains at least on example.

Improvements
